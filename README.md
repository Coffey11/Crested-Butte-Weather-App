Crested Butte Weather App:
This was my final project for my first coding class in college. It is a weather app that pulls weather information from an API and displays the information using a GUI made using tkinter.
It also lets you know if you should skip class and go skiing if the weather conditions are great.
With the json file included in this repository the data is not live. The API that I used only has a very limited number of calls but each call is the same with updated data.

Installation and Usage Intructions:
1. Download all files included and make sure they are all in the same directory
2. Run the .py however you like

Features:
Python
API
tkinter
